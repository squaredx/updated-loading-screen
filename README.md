# updated-loading-screen

__HEAVY WORK IN PROGRESS DO NOT USE IN PRODUCTION__

A mod for Venice Unleashed that updated the dated loading screen in BF3.

### Todo:

- hide the screen once loading is done
- implement a system for detecting when the loading screen is showing (not just on joining)
- fade in the loading screen
- add server info box 
- hooks for other mods?
- mod list?
- server details box text wrap
- refresh rate display needs to be more readable and actually work
